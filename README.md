## About the Repository

This repository is structured to provide:
- **Lab Tasks**: Hands-on practice with key ML concepts and algorithms.
- **Assignments**: Challenging problems to deepen understanding.
- **Projects**: End-to-end implementations of Machine Learning solutions.

It is ideal for students, educators, and self-learners interested in exploring ML through practical examples.


## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **ML Labs**: Contains lab tasks that focus on fundamental ML techniques and algorithms. I have not included labs of all topics, you can find missing topics in assignments folder(files). 
- **ML Assignments**: Includes assignments designed to reinforce theoretical concepts with practical implementation.
- **ML Project**: A comprehensive ML project on **Clinical Insight Prediction System** showcasing the application of various techniques like ***Artifical Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression*** to predict diseases eg. ***skin cancer, asthama, heart disease, and kidney disease***.

Each directory contains detailed Jupyter notebooks and supporting files to help users understand and implement ML concepts.
